### **What is Infrastructure as Code?**
*IaC is the practice of Managing and Provisioning Infrastructure using Code instead of manual processes.*
> ##### Infrastructure as Code is a method where infrastructure is defined, provisioned, and managed using machine-readable configuration files, ensuring consistency, automation, version control, and scalability across environments..

##### **Why Infrastructure as Code?**
- **Consistency:** Identical environments across dev, staging, and production.
- **Time Efficiency:** Automated provisioning saves hours of manual work.
- **Cost Management:** Easy to track costs and automate cleanup.
- **Scalability:** Deploy to hundreds of servers with same effort as one.
- **Version Control:** Track changes in Git
- **Reduced Human Error:** Eliminate manual configuration mistakes.
- **Collaboration:** Team can work together on infrastructure.
##### **Benefits of IaC**
- Consistent environment deployment.
- Easy to track and manage costs.
- Write once, deploy many (single codebase)
- Time-saving automation.
- Reduced human error.
- Cost optimization through automation.
- Version control for infrastructure changes.
- Automated cleanup and scheduled destruction.
- Developer focus on application development.
- Easy creation of identical production environments for troubleshooting.
